# Improving sktime's Notebook Example Navigation: Task-Based Organization (Addresses Issue #7521)

This document proposes improvements to the navigation of the "Notebook Examples" section in the `sktime` documentation, specifically addressing the lack of clear organization and the difficulty in finding task-specific examples, as highlighted in issue #7521.

# Improving sktime's Notebook Example Navigation: Focus on Task-Based Organization

This document proposes improvements to the navigation of the "Notebook Examples" section in the `sktime` documentation, specifically addressing the need for better organization based on machine learning tasks. This directly addresses the issue raised regarding the lack of subheadings and difficulty in finding relevant examples.

## Current Issue

The current "Notebook Examples" section lacks sufficient organization, particularly around the Notebook Examples. This makes it difficult for users to quickly find examples related to specific time series tasks.

## Proposed Solutions (Focused on the Issue)

The core improvement focuses on organizing notebooks by common machine learning tasks related to time series data:

1.  **Categorization by Learning Task:** Organize the notebooks into subsections based on the following tasks:

    *   **Classification:** Examples demonstrating time series classification techniques.
    *   **Regression:** Examples demonstrating time series regression techniques.
    *   **Clustering:** Examples showcasing time series clustering algorithms.
    *   **Forecasting:** Examples related to point forecasting, probabilistic forecasting, hierarchical forecasting, etc.
    *   **Detection (Anomaly/Change Point):** Examples focused on detecting anomalies and change points in time series data.

## Example of Improved Structure

The following demonstrates a possible improved structure for the "Notebook Examples" section, focusing *only* on the task-based organization:
Notebook Examples
├── Classification
│   ├── Time Series Classification with sktime.ipynb
│   └── ... (more specific classification examples)
├── Regression
│   ├── Time Series Regression with sktime.ipynb
|   └── ...
├── Clustering
│   ├── Time Series Clustering with sktime.ipynb
│   └
├── Forecasting
│   ├── Introduction to Forecasting with sktime.ipynb
│   ├── Probabilistic Forecasting.ipynb
│   ├── Hierarchical Forecasting.ipynb
│   └── (more specific forecasting examples)
├── Detection (Anomaly/Change Point)
├── Anomaly, changepoint, and segment detection with sktime and skchange.ipynb
└── ...
## Rationale and Benefits (Related to the Issue)

This task-based organization directly addresses the core issue by:

*   **Improving Navigation:** Users can quickly find relevant examples based on their specific learning task of interest (classification, regression, forecasting, etc.).
*   **Enhancing Discoverability:** By grouping similar examples, users can more easily discover the range of `sktime`'s capabilities for each task.

## Addressing Other Suggested Improvements (Out of Scope for this Focused Contribution)

While other suggestions like sections for "Data Types," "Data Transformations," "Benchmarks," and smaller, more focused notebooks are valuable, they are considered out of scope for *this specific contribution*. This contribution focuses solely on the core issue of task-based organization within the "Notebook Examples" section. These other suggestions could be addressed in separate, follow-up contributions.

## Conclusion

By implementing this task-based organization, we directly address the stated issue of poor navigation within the "Notebook Examples" section. This focused approach provides a clear improvement while allowing for other enhancements to be addressed separately.
